# chattris
A social networking website with the MEAN stack

Have you ever wanted to start your own chat server?

You've come to the right place.

If you're running windows on your computer, you will have to download and install node.js from nodejs.org.

Let's get started.

INSTALLATION
First, download node.js from the above URL.

Next, finish installing it.

To confirm its installation, press the windows key and the "R" key simultaneously. 
In the windows that appears after doing so, please type in "cmd"
In the new black window, please type in "node -v". It must NOT say something like " 'node' is not recognized as an internal or external command, batch file or etc. "
Also, type in "npm -v". It must NOT tell you something like "" 'npm' is not recognized as an internal or external command, batch file or etc. "
For the above two, the window should tell you the version no. of the downloaded program (nodejs)

Moving on to running the chat server:
Download this from the homepage of this app "chattris"
Here is the URL to download the same : https://github.com/cuteram2008/chattris/archive/master.zip

Now create a new folder in a place of your choice, prefereble in "Documents",name it "chattris" (or a name of your preference, if you choose a different name, you'll have to type in the name you have chosen in line 31) and extract the contents from the above download.

Here comes the magic:
Open command prompt (refer to line 15 to know how to open it)
Type "cd Documents" and hit enter
It should say something like C:\Users\Your_user_name\Documents\>
Type "cd chattris(or the name you have selected, if it differs)" and hit enter.
Now, the last, long part of the installations: Type in "npm install" and hit enter. If everything goes well, this operation will take some time. Or else, it will terminate in a matter of seconds.

After "npm install" has finished, and C:\Users\Your_user_name\Documents\chattris(or the name you selected) appears on your screen, good.
DON'T CLOSE THE BLACK WINDOW (CMD)

RUNNING THE SERVER

Type in "node index.js"
Don't close cmd yet.

Open up the internet browser of your choice.
On the top URL bar, type in "localhost:8080"
If everything went well, It must display a webpage with title "Chattris"
